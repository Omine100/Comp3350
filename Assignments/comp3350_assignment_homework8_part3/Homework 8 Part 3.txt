A. 	AX: 8642
   	DX: B000

  	If mov dx, 0 is not placed at the beginning, then AX will remain unchanged, 
	but DX will be some other unpredictable value.

B. 	An IDIV instruction causes an overflow when the quotient is too big to fit in the operand.

C. 	DX:AX = FFFF FFFE
	
	This could be used in a 16-bit computer to get to values only a 32-bit computer could produce.
	By having this the process has values in that whole range, so it is very useful for computations
	along with many other procedures.
