			- Converting binary to decimal
				- 1011 = 1 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^1 + 1
			- Converting decimal to binary
				- Divide by 2 till zero
				- Take the remainders and flip
			- Ranges

				- Formed by inverting its bits and adding 1
			- Converting signed binary to decimal
				- If MSB is 1
					- Create two's complement

				- X = 11111111, Y = 00011100, X ^ Y = 00011100
			- OR: Requires two operands and output is true when at least one operand is true
				- X = 11101100, Y = 00011100, X [OR] Y = 11111100
		- Order of precedence
			- NOT has highest, then the others (unless parentheses are involved)
- Chapter 2:
	- Definitions
		- Central processor unit (CPU): Where calculations and logical operations take place
			- Contains limited registers, a high-frequency clock, a control unit, and an arithmetic logic unit
		- Register: High-speed storage locations inside the CPU
			- General-purpose registers: Used for arithmetic and data movement
				- 32-bit ex: E[A,B,C,D]X, E[B,S]P, E[D,S]I
				- 16-bit ex: AX
				- 8-bit ex (only for A,B,C,D X): AH (high), AL (low)
		- Clock: Synchronizes the internal operations of the CPU with other components
			- A machine instruction requires at least one clock cycle to execute
		- Control unit (CU): Coordinates the sequencing of steps involved in executing machine instructions
		- Arithmetic logic unit (ALU): Performs arithmetic operations and logic operations
		- Bus: Group of parallel wires that transfer data from one part of the computer to another
			- Types: data, I/O, control, and address
				- Data: Transfers instructions between CPU and memory
				- I/O: Transfers data between CPU and I/O devices
				- Control: Uses binary signals to synchronize all actions attached to system bus
				- Address: Holds the addresses of instructions when something transfers data
		- Cache: Programs want to access the same memory, caches keep these values for quick running
			- Cache hit: When the processor is able to find its data in cache memory
			- Cache miss: When the processor is unable to find its data in cache memory
			- Levels
				- Level 1: Cache on the CPU
				- Level 2: Bit slower than level 1 and attached to the CPU by a high-speed data bus
		- Program loader: Loads a program into memory so it can run
		- Protected mode: Native state of the processor, all instructions and features are available
			- Programs are given separate memory segments
				- Programs cannot reference memory outside their segment
		- Read-address mode: Implements environment of early Intel processor with a few extra features
			- Can switch into other modes
			- Direct access to system memory and hardware devices
		- System management mode: Provides an operating system with power and system security management features
		- Virtual-8086 mode: While in protected mode, the processor can execute MS-DOS safely
			- If a crash occurs, it will not affect other programs running at the same time
		- Device drivers: Programs that permit the OS to communicate directly with hardware devices and the BIOS
	- General concepts
		- Instruction execution cycle
			- CPU has to go through this cycle to execute an instruction (fetch, decode and execute)
				1. Fetch the instruction
				2. Decodes binary pattern
				3. Fetches operands from registers and memory
				4. Executes the instruction, using operands from before
				5. Stores the result of its execution in output operand
		- Reading from memory
			- Computers read memory much slower than they access internal registers
				- Reading requires four steps
					1. Place the address of what you want to read on the address bus
					2. Change the value of the processor's read pin
					3. Wait one clock cycle for the memory chips to respond
					4. Copy the data from the data bus into the destination operand
	- 32-bit processors
		- Modes of operation
			- Protected, read-address, system management, virtual-8086
	- Input-output system
		- Levels
			- High-level language functions: Java contains functions to perform I/O
			- Operating system: Can call OS functions from API library
			- BIOS: Basic input-output system is a collection of routines the communicate with hardware
- Chapter 3:
	- Definitions
		- Integer literals (constant): Made up of an optional leading sign, one or more digits, radix for base
			- Ex: [{+ | -}] digits [radix {h, o, d, b, r, t, y}]
			- Hexadecimal literal beginning with a letter must have a leading zero
		- Constant integer expression: Mathematicall expression involving integer literals and arithmetic operators
			- Use parentheses in expressions to clarify order of operations
			- 16/5 = 3
		- Character literals: Single character enclosed in single or double quotes, stores as ASCII code
		- String literals: Sequence of characters & spaces enclosed in single or double quotes, stores as ASCII codes
		- Reserved words: Have special meaning and can only bbe used in their correct context
			- Types
				- Instructions (mov, add, mul)
				- Register names
				- Directives
				- Attributes (byte, word)
				- Operators
		- Identifiers: Program-chosen name to identify a variable, constant, procedure or code label
		- Directives: Command embedded in source code that is acted upon by the assembleer
			- Do not execute at runtime, but let you define variables, macros and procedures
		- Instruction: Statement that becomes executable when a program is assembled
			- Label: (optional) instruction mnemonic [operands] [; comment]
		- Label: Identifier that acts as a place marker for instructions and data
			- Date label: Identifies the location of a varible
				- Ex: count DWORD 100
				- If you put more than one data item after a label, they follow directly afterwards in memory
			- Label in a code segment must end with a colon, these are used for jumping and looping
		- Instruction mnemonic: Short word that identifies an instruction
			- Ex: mov, add, sub, mul, jmp, call
		- Operands: Value that is used for I/O for an instruction
			- With multiple operands, the first is the typically the destination and the second is the source
		- Comments: Showing information to the reader
			- Single-line: Begin with a semicolon character
			- Block: Use COMMENT directive followed by a symbol, add comments, end with symbol again
		- No operation instruction: Takes up 1 byte and doesn't do any work
			- Helps programs be more efficient by getting to an even multiple of 4
	- Basic language elements
		- .code, .data, .stack are directives called segments
	- Assembling, linking, and running programs
		- The assemble-link-execute cycle
			- Steps
				1. A programmer uses a text editor to create an ASCII text file named the source file
				2. Assembler reads the source file and produces an object file
					- If errors occur, it creates a listing file
				3. Linker reads the object file, gets procedures from link library, and produces an executable file
				4. OS loader utility reads the executable file into memory, points CPU to starting address, executes
